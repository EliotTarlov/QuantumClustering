Chapter 7
Ideas for Chapter 6 revision
7.1 Basic terminology
Define the following terms.
• Hilbert space
• Hermitian matrix
• state |ψ⟩ of a quantum system
• energy of a system in state |ψ⟩
• ground state: lowest energy state ψ∗ = argmin ... for all ψ ∈ H (hilbert space)
• Hamiltonian
– is considered to be an “operator”
– matrix representation as a Hermitian matrix
– role = describing possible energy of the system
• The notation H|x⟩
• Energy of a system in the state |ψ⟩: the expected value of ψ with respect to H
denoted as ⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩
7.2 Variational method
Goal: approximate ground state ψ∗ and lowest energy E∗
Steps: Two main steps
1. Choose trial state (aka ansatz) |ψ(θ)⟩
2. Vary θ to minimize E(θ) = ⟨ψ(θ)|H|ψ(θ)⟩ and θ∗ = argmin ... E(θ) for all
θ

Implications:
• E(θ∗) is an upper bound for E∗
• |ψ(θ∗)⟩ approximates |ψ∗⟩
7.3 Variational Quantum Circuit
VQC = QC that depends on θ
Then, show the big picture, i.e., picture like slide page 8
7.4 Quadratic programs
General description. Then discuss QUBO followed by material in section 6.1
7.5 Max-Cut and QUBO problem corresponding
to Max-Cut
7.5.1 Max-Cut
Input:
Output:
Example instance of a max-cut problem (Part of the first paragraph in 6.3)
Example solution to the problem, i.e., a cut
Cost function
Hardness of Max-cut
7.5.2 QUBO problem corresponding to Max-cut
Contents in this subsection should be as analogous to the previous subsection as
possible (with the exception of the subsubsection concerning hardness).
